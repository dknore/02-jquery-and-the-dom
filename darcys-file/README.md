# jQuery and the Dom

**Author**: Darcy Knore
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This application was built to display my blog articles.  I wanted the application to display in a clear, and logical manner, with the most recent articles displayed first, and easy to read.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
1. In Javascript: Create an object array identifying the components (through key/value pairs) you wish to encompass in your blog. Then create a Constructor Function (with methods for needed functioning) that you can pass your object array through.
2. Create CSS files to reflect your desired styling for application.
4. Create a basic HTML framework, making sure to link your css files, and your js files!

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
This application was written in HTML, CSS, and javascript. jQuery was also used in article.js for efficiency. The Code Fellows avatar was used in the meta tag.

## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:
01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with GET and POST routes for the book resource. -->
12-04-2017 1:36pm - Application is complete and ready to be launched.

## Credits and Collaborations
